## Overview
nefrikinoso is a machine learning project focused on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). It utilizes various machine learning models to provide accurate CKD predictions and includes tools for model evaluation and user interaction.

## Features
* Preprocesses and prepares the CKD dataset.
* Trains and evaluates model performance using relevant metrics.
* Offers a web interface for user interaction and predictions.
* Provides an API endpoint for making predictions programmatically.
* Generates visualizations for model evaluation and feature analysis.
- Includes the following implementations:
  - **Novel ðŸ¤–** Voting Ensemble
  - **Novel ðŸ¤–** Stacked Ensemble Learning
  - XGBoost
  - SVM
  - Decision Tree
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - CatBoost
  - Neural Network

## Usage (Docker)
`docker run netherquark/nefrikinoso`

## Installation (Regular)
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage (Regular)
### Training and Visualisation
Run the models and generate visualisations using `python main.py`.
